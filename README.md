# meetup_colab fix for colab to run NVidia NeMo 2.0

## To run NeMo 2.0 requires downgrade of cuda 12.5 which is installed by default to cuda 12.4 

Notes: colab pro subscription at $9.99 per month is the best deal for an A100 but is difficult to use. Doesn't run docker containers, can't run parallel distributed instances and the subscription is required if you want a terminal. Otherwise free.
